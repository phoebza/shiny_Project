## DEVELOPING DATA PRODUCTS

COURSE PROJECT 

author      : Phoebe  
job         : Data Science

--- .class #id 


## INTRODUCTION

This presentation is part of the Course Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class. The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application. This presentation adresses the second part of the course project.

The app developed for this part of the assignment is avalilable at:

https://phoebza.shinyapps.io/shiny_project/

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub:

## SELECT THE OF YOUR CHOICE

This application gives you a choice to choose the distribution and generate the data randomly.
This allows you to plot the histogram to investigate the distribution curve with the mean calculated
and indicated for each distribution.  

The summary of data generated is in the 'summary' tab with data generated in the 'table' tab.
